I am a graduate student and this is my first semester at Northwest.

I came all the way from Hyderabad, India to do my master’s degree. Prior to joining Northwest, I have worked for Accenture as SAP Human capital management (HCM) consultant with  experience of 1.5 years and got opportunity to work with multiple clients. I have done my bachelor’s degree in computer science major from Karunya University, India.

I want to explore latest technologies and looking forward to work on mobile app development.

I love to drive and explore new places.
